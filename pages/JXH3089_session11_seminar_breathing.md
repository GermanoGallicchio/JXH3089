```

::left::

### Lecture
- Lecturer explains the Quiet Eye effect
  - what is the Quiet Eye
  - relation between Quiet Eye and performance
  - how is it _typically_ measured
  - how it can be measured with the EOG
- We will watch the _core_ video together and comment on it

<br>

::right::

### Supervised study
- Each student group will read one of the key papers associated with this seminar

<br>


### Flipped classroom
- Each student group will **present** the main ideas of their paper to the other group(s) and **critically reflect** on how the study contributes to understanding the mechanisms behind the phenomenon (why is QE associated with performance?)

Is there an optimal oculomotor pattern for better performance?

# The Quiet Eye effect

<br>

Performance advantage conferred by a **steady ocular fixation** on a critical target of an action

<br>

### Quiet Eye is the time duration wherein:
- gaze is on a critical visual target of the action (e.g., golf ball)
- onset before movement initiation
- offset when gaze deviates from target _of a certain quantity_

# How is the QE _typically_ measured?
<br>
It requires measuring time during which the critical object lies within 3Â° of visual angles
