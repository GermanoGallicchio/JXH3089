# EEG workshop

Role playing: students alternate roles between experimenter, participant, and observer.

Task 1. Application of sensors
- identify midline landmarks Nasion and Inion 
- place the cap aligned with Cz

Task 2. The students work collaboratively to recreate and identify some common sources of artefacts. They also reflect on the morphology of those artefacts (what do they look like in EEG recordings?) and regional influence (which electrodes are showing the artefacts?.

| type of artefact  | morphology of the artefact | location of the artefact |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| muscular activity |  s  |  s  |
| blinking          |  s  |  s  |
| eye movements     |  s  |  s  |


Task 3. Self-regulate cortical activity
- increase parietal-occipital alpha activity (relax with eyes closed)
- decrease alpha activity (heavy cognitive load with eyes open)
- P300?
