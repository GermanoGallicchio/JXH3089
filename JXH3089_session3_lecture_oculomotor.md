# Why study eye movements
<br>

Studying eye movements is useful for several purposes:

<v-clicks>

- **Research**: Studying the relationship between eye movements and cognitive processes, such as attention and memory at rest or while performing certain activities (e.g., reading, computer work, consumer behaviour)
- **Sleep**: Monitoring eye movements during different sleep stages, particularly REM sleep.
- **Human-computer interface**: Developing eye-tracking systems for controlling computers and other devices (e.g., wheelchair, speller).
- **Fatigue and sleepiness monitoring**: In fields like transportation or aviation, EOG can help monitor alertness by detecting patterns associated with drowsiness.
- **Sport**: Analyzing athletes' eye movements to improve performance and training techniques.

# Muscular control of the eyes

# Types of eye movements
<br>

<v-clicks>

- Saccades 
- Nystagmus
- Smooth movements
- Fixational movements
 
</v-clicks>

---

## Saccades
<br>

- Quick jumps from one fixation point to another
- They allow to _foveate_ objects or locations
  - foveate = direct the eyes so that image of interest in reflected in the part of the retina with most photoreceptors called fovea
- One of the fastest human movements, with angular speed  up to 700Â°/s

---

## Fixational movements
<br>

>Far from being a quiet interlude between eye movements, fixation is a lively period of continuous albeit microscopic motion, full of complex interactions that we are just beginning to understand.<br><br>
Krauzlis et al. (2017)[^1]

mostly involuntary

main function: avoiding retinal image fading

several types:
- Microsaccades (tiny jerky movements)
- Drift (slow wandering movements)
- Tremor (rapid oscillations)

---

## Smooth movements

Slow movements of the eyes to allow fixation under moving conditions

Two types:

<v-clicks>

- **smooth pursuit movements** The eyes track a moving object through slow conjugate movements. The head might be still.

Try... you can't without anything to track


- **smooth compensatory movements** The eyes fixate on a still object but the head and/or the body move

Try... pick a point and move your head

</v-clicks>


---

## Nystagmus

- Rhythmic movements
- from Greek "drowsy"

Two types:
- clinical
- non-clinical
  - _vestibular_: compensations for rhythmic head movements
  - _optokinetic_: watching a moving pattern (e.g., a train passing by)

# The eye as a dipole

::left::

- The _corneoretinal_ (or corneofundal) potential: The retina (or fundus) is electrically more negative then the cornea

- Greater negativity in the retina is due to metabolic activity due to neurons and photoreceptors

- In fact, the corneoretinal potential changes with lower photoreceptor activity (e.g., in darkness or with eyes closed). Changes in the corneoretinal potential are slow. The corneoretinal potential is relatively stable over minutes.

## Bipolar channels

When two electrodes are "referenced" to one another, their montage is called "bipolar"

<br>
<br>

::left::

### Horizontal EOG channel 
$hEOG = LO_1-LO2$

::right::

### Vertical EOG channel 
$vEOG_{left} = SO1 - IO1$

$vEOG_{right} = SO2 - IO2$

$vEOG = \frac{vEOG_{left}+vEOG_{right}}{2}$

---
level: 3

### horizontal EOG signal 
Note: hEOG computed as $LO1 - LO2$

## Impact of high-pass filtering 

_DC_ (direct current) used to indicate that high-pass filter is _not_ applied

_AC_ (alternate current) used to indicate that high-pass filter is applied

AC acquisition is often performed by certain equipment (e.g., PowerLab)

## EOG calibration

::left::

The native units of the EOG are _Volts_, but eye movements are better described as _visual angles_. 

This is because eye movements are angular (rotation of the eyeball).

**Calibration** allows to compute how many Volts correspond to 1 degree of visual angle.

Then we can convert EOG from Volts to degrees.

::right::

<img src="./images/eogCalibration.png" style="width:100%; margin:auto" >

---

<img src="./images/eogCalibration2.png" style="width:100%; margin:auto" >

---
layout: two-cols
---

The EOG signal is now represented in degrees of visual angle.

Because the source of the EOG (the corneoretinal potential) is not fixed, calibration should be done every few minutes.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The figure shows **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **combined** EOG signals. 

The combined signal is computed as the vectorial sum of the calibrated horizontal and vertical signals.

## Physiological source of the EOG blink 

<br>

Not as well understood as the source of eye movements (corneoretinal potential)

<v-clicks>

Initially thought to be due to upward rotation of the eyeball (rapid dipole rotation)

More recently thought to be due to eyelid bridging the corneoretinal positivity with the forehead (changes in electrical conductivity)

</v-clicks>


---

## EOG Blink wave characteristics

<br>

<v-clicks>

- Typical duration: 200-400 ms
- Biphasic pattern
  - Initial positive deflection
  - Followed by negative component
- Amplitude typically larger than saccades
- More prominent in vertical than horizontal channels

</v-clicks>

## EOG Limitations
<br>

While EOG is a useful technique, it has some limitations:

<v-clicks>

- **Signal noise**: EOG signals can be affected by electrical noise from other sources, such as muscle activity and external electronic devices.

- **Artifact contamination**: Blinks and other involuntary eye movements can introduce artifacts into the EOG signal, complicating data analysis.

- **head movement confounders**: EOG saccadic signals reflect movements of the eyeballs relative to the head. By looking at the EOG only or without behavioural constrains, it is difficult to know whether the eyes, the head, or both have moved. 

- **Limited spatial resolution**: EOG provides less precise information about the exact point of gaze compared to other eye-tracking methods, such as video-based eye trackers.

- **Calibration drift**: The corneoretinal potential can change over time, requiring frequent recalibration.

## Future Directions

Research and development in EOG technology are ongoing, with several promising directions:

<v-clicks>

- **Improved signal processing**: Developing advanced algorithms to reduce noise and artifacts in EOG signals. A promising technique is median filtering[^1].

- **Integration with other modalities**: Combining EOG with other physiological measurements, such as EEG and EMG, for a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior.[^2]

- **Wearable EOG devices**: Creating portable and user-friendly EOG systems for real-world applications, such as sports training and assistive technology.
